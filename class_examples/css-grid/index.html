                    <p class="half-1">Maren Morris is one of the leading voices in country music today—armed with incredible vocal stylings that reflect her country, folk and pop influences, sheer talent, honest lyrics and a strong presence. Morris’ latest
                        album GIRL,
                        released
                        in March 2019 via Columbia Nashville, was named Album of the Year at the 53rd Annual Country Music Association Awards, where Morris was the most nominated artist. The album shattered the record for the largest ever debut streaming week
                        for
                        a
                        country album by a woman with 23.96 million streams and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and No. 4 on the Billboard 200. Single “The Bones” has just become the first multi-week country radio No. 1 from a woman
                        since
                        2012. GIRL also features the history-making title track “GIRL” which had the highest debut on Billboard’s Country Streaming Songs chart by a female artist, the highest weekly streams by a female country artist ever and also topped country
                        radio. GIRL comes three years after Morris’ breakout, Gold-certified debut album Hero and explores how her life has changed since then—</p>
                    <p class="half-2">a skyrocketing career, falling in love, becoming engaged and then married—and the highs and lows in
                        between. She won a Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance at the 59th Grammy Awards, was named New Artist of the Year at the 50th Annual CMA Awards, Top Country Female Artist at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards and New
                        Female
                        Vocalist
                        of the Year at the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards. Morris was also the most-played female artist on country radio in 2017 and 2018. The 29-year-old from Arlington, Texas got her start playing in bars around her hometown and quickly
                        made
                        a name for herself with Hero and its 2x Platinum-selling “My Church,” Platinum-selling “80s Mercedes” and “I Could Use A Love Song,” and Gold-selling “Rich”. Hero and its singles topped charts nationwide, set Country radio records, and
                        were
                        some of the most critically-acclaimed works of 2016. After an entire year of touring with her award winning album GIRL for a year she and her husband, Ryan Hurd are expecting a little boy. </p>
